# Getting Started

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Flutter and have already set up your development environment.
If you're new to Flutter, you may follow the official [installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started).

## Installation

From your Flutter project directory, run the following command to install Forui.

```bash filename="bash" copy
flutter pub add forui
```

### Forui Icons

<Callout type="info">
    Forui Icons is bundled with the forui package. You don't need to install it separately if you install `forui`.
</Callout>

If you would like to only use the icons, run the following command from your Flutter project's directory.

```bash filename="bash" copy
flutter pub add forui_assets
```

## Usage

To use Forui widgets in your Flutter app, import the Forui package and place the
[`FTheme`](https://pub.dev/documentation/forui/latest/forui.theme/FTheme-class.html) widget underneath `CupertinoApp`,
`MaterialApp`, or `WidgetsApp` at the root of the widget tree.

You can run:

```shell copy
dart run forui init
```

to generate a basic Forui app structure in your project.

It is perfectly fine to use Cupertino/Material widgets alongside Forui widgets!

```dart filename="main.dart" {3,12-18} copy
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'package:forui/forui.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const Application());
}

class Application extends StatelessWidget {
  const Application({super.key});

  Widget build(BuildContext context) => MaterialApp(
    builder: (context, child) => FTheme(
      data: FThemes.zinc.light,
      child: child!,
    ),
    home: FScaffold(...)
  );
}
```

### Themes

Forui provides a set of predefined themes that you can use out of the box.
In the example above, we used the `FThemes.zinc.light` theme, which is a light theme variant of the zinc color scheme.

Themes are a very powerful building block in Forui, allowing you to customize the look and feel of your app.
To learn more about themes, refer to the [Themes](/docs/themes) page.
