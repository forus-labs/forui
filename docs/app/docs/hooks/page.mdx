# Hooks

Forui provides first class integration with [Flutter Hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks). All controllers
are exposed as hooks in the companion `forui_hooks` package.

## Installation

From your Flutter project directory, run the following command to install `flutter_hooks` and `forui_hooks`.

```bash filename="bash" copy
flutter pub add flutter_hooks
flutter pub add forui_hooks
```

## Usage

To use Forui hooks in your Flutter app, import the `forui_hooks` package and initialize a hook inside a `HookWidget`.

```dart {5, 7, 10} copy
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';

import 'package:forui/forui.dart';
import 'package:forui_hooks/forui_hooks.dart';

class Example extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final controller = useFAccordionController();
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        FAccordion(
          controller: controller,
          items: [
            FAccordionItem(
              title: const Text('Is it accessible?'),
              child: const Text('Yes. It adheres to the WAI-ARIA design pattern.'),
            ),
            FAccordionItem(
              initiallyExpanded: true,
              title: const Text('Is it Styled?'),
              child: const Text("Yes. It comes with default styles that matches the other components' aesthetics"),
            ),
            FAccordionItem(
              title: const Text('Is it Animated?'),
              child: const Text('Yes. It is animated by default, but you can disable it if you prefer'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```
