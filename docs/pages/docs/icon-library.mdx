# Icon

Forui Assets is flutter library that provides a set of high-quality icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/).


## Installation

<Callout type="info">
    Forui Assets is bundled with forui package. You don't need to install it separately if you installed `forui`.
</Callout>

From your Flutter project directory, run the following command to install Forui Assets.

```bash filename="bash"
flutter pub install forui_assets
```


## Usage

<Callout type="info">
    The best way to find a list of icons is to visit the [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons/) website.
    We periodically update the icons in the Forui Assets package.
    If you notice a missing icon in Forui Assets, please [open an issue](https://github.com/forus-labs/forui/issues/new).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
    While you can use an icon from `forui_assets` directly, it is recommended to wrap it in an [FIcon](/docs/icon) to
    automatically configure its color and size.
</Callout>

```dart
import 'package:forui/forui.dart';

// alternatively; if you've only installed forui_assets.
import 'package:forui_assets/forui_assets.dart';

// Dog icon as a Widget. It is recommended to wrap icons in FIcon if you're using Forui.
final dogIconWidget = FIcon(FAssets.icons.dog);

// Bird icon as a Widget.
final birdIconWidget = FAssets.icons.bird();

// White cat icon with a size of 24x24.
final catIconWidget = FAssets.icons.cat(
  width: 24,
  height: 24,
  colorFilter: const ColorFilter.mode(Color(0xFFFFFFFF), BlendMode.srcIn),
);

// Saving an icon to a variable for later use.
final rabbitSvgAsset = FAssets.icons.rabbit;
final rabbitIconWidget = rabbitSvgAsset();
```
