# Getting Started

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Flutter and have already set up your development environment.
If you're new to Flutter, you may follow the official [installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started).

## Installation

From your Flutter project directory, run the following command to install Forui.

```bash filename="bash"
flutter pub install forui
```

### Forui Icons

<Callout type="info">
    Forui Icons is bundled with forui package. You don't need to install it separately if you installed `forui`.
</Callout>

If you would like to only use the icon package, run the following command from your Flutter project directory.

```bash filename="bash"
flutter pub install forui_icons
```

## Usage

To use Forui widgets in your Flutter app, import the Forui package and place the `FTheme` widget at the root of the widget tree.

```dart filename="main.dart" {3,12-16}
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';

import 'package:forui/forui.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const Application());
}

class Application extends StatelessWidget {
  const Application({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => FTheme(
    data: FThemes.zinc.light,
    child: const FScaffold(...),
  );
}
```

### Themes

Forui provides a set of predefined themes that you can use out of the box.
In the example above, we used the `FThemes.zinc.light` theme, which is a light theme variant of the zinc color scheme.

Themes are a very powerful building block in Forui, allowing you to customize the look and feel of your app.
To learn more about themes, refer to the [Themes](/docs/themes) page.

### With Material/Cupertino

It's perfectly safe to use Forui widgets alongside Material/Cupertino widgets.
This is especially useful when you need to use a Material/Cupertino widget that is not available in Forui or require it for routing.
(eg. `MaterialApp.router` or `CupertinoApp.router`)

```dart filename="main.dart"
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) => MaterialApp(
  // Other configurations...
  home: FTheme(
    data: FThemes.zinc.light,
    child: const FScaffold(...),
  ),
);
```
