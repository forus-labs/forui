## Core Principles

**Forui** is a UI library for Flutter that provides a set of minimalistic widgets heavily inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).


Flutter shines as a powerful multi-platform development tool, but its native Material and Cupertino widgets often fall short of truly universal design.
Forui strives to be the default platform-agnostic alternative for developers seeking consistent and elegant UIs across all devices.

The library is designed with the following core principles in mind:
- **Platform Agnostic Design:** Our widgets are crafted to seamlessly adapt to various platforms, ensuring a cohesive and polished look across devices.
- **Touch-First Interaction:** We prioritize touch interactions, providing a natural and responsive feel for mobile and tablet users.
- **Minimalistic Aesthetics:** Our library embraces simplicity and clean design principles, delivering a visually appealing and uncluttered user interface.
- **Extensible and Customizable:** We encourage customization and provide flexible options to tailor components to your unique design needs.
