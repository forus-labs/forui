description: Enable localization for Forui widgets across 115 languages.
---

Forui supports all 115 languages that Flutter natively does.

To enable localization for Forui widgets, add the `FLocalizations.delegate` in your call to the constructor for `CupertinoApp`, `MaterialApp`, or `WidgetsApp`. Afterwards, add the locales supported by your application.

```dart {3, 6} copy
MaterialApp(
  localizationsDelegates: [
    FLocalizations.delegate, // Add this line
  ],
  supportedLocales: [
    // Add locales supported by your application here.
  ],
  builder: (context, child) => FAnimatedTheme(
    data: FThemes.zinc.light,
    child: child!,
  ),
  home: FScaffold(...),
);
```

The `FLocalizations` class also provides auto-generated `localizationsDelegates` and `supportedLocales` lists. You can use
these instead of providing them manually if your application doesn't have any other localization messages.

```dart {2-3} copy
MaterialApp(
  localizationsDelegates: FLocalizations.localizationsDelegates,
  supportedLocales: FLocalizations.supportedLocales,
  builder: (context, child) => FAnimatedTheme(
    data: FThemes.zinc.light,
    child: child!,
  ),
  home: FScaffold(...),
);
```
